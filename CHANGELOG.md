## [2.1.12-beta] (Build 2095)

### 🚀 Improved

- Added "Legacy Set" & "Custom Set" categorization

### 🐛 Fixed

- Fixed stuck "Loading Assets 0/0" overlay by moving silent cache validation to background task.

## [2.1.12-beta] (Build 2094)

### 🚀 Improved

- **Installer**: Significantly reduced uninstaller size (~140MB -> ~70MB) by separating the payload from the uninstaller executable.
- **Uninstaller**: Implemented smart mode detection — slim uninstaller now correctly auto-detects "Uninstall" mode when run directly.
- **Uninstaller**: Enhanced self-deletion reliability with a PID-based wait loop to ensure the process exits fully before file removal.
- **UI**: Added terminal-retro style `[ OK ]` completion symbols and removed the "Launch" button from the uninstall success screen.

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Registry**: Updated Help, Update, and About URLs to point to the official website `https://ardysamods.my.id`.
- **Uninstaller**: Fixed "Reinstall" showing instead of "Uninstall" when running the uninstaller directly.
- **UI**: Fixed version number overflow in Update mode by stacking old/new versions vertically.
- **Uninstaller**: Fixed race condition where self-deletion failed if the window wasn't closed immediately.

---

## [2.1.12-beta] (Build 2093)

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Skin Selector**: Fixed progress overlay appearing on every open by implementing a smart cooldown mechanism. Now skips the overlay entirely if thumbnails are cached and recently checked (within 10 mins).

---

## [2.1.12-beta] (Build 2092)

### 🚀 Added

- **Settings**: Added Clear Cache button with trash icon and live cache size display to the WebView2 settings dialog.

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Settings**: Fixed Close/✕ buttons hanging — `SafeClose()` now always defers via `BeginInvoke` to avoid disposing WebView2 mid-event.
- **Settings**: Fixed Run on Startup toggle silently failing — now checks `SetRunOnStartup` return value and reverts the toggle with error toast on failure.

### 🗑️ Removed

- **Legacy**: Deleted orphaned `SettingsForm.cs` (WinForms) and `SettingsPresenter.cs` (unused MVP presenter wired to dead form).

---

## [2.1.12-beta] (Build 2091)

### 📖 Documentation

- **README.md**: Comprehensive rewrite with detailed features table, system requirements, quick start guide, full architecture overview (tech stack, project structure tree, ADR links), developer build instructions, collapsible FAQ, troubleshooting table, and credits section acknowledging Dota 2 SkinChanger community, modders, Valve, and open-source libraries.

---

## [2.1.12-beta] (Build 2090)

### 🐛 Fixed

- **InstallationDetector**: Fixed critical logic bug where legacy Inno Setup installations were ignored if the new registry key existed but pointed to a different path (e.g., portable move). Now checks both keys independently.
- **InstallerService**: Implemented atomic extract-then-swap pattern. Installation now extracts to a temporary directory first and only swaps files upon success, preventing broken installs if the process is interrupted.
- **InstallerUpdateStrategy**: Added PE header validation (MZ bytes) and minimum size check (50KB) for downloaded installers to prevent launching corrupted or truncated files.
- **App**: Added `Mutex`-based single-instance enforcement to prevent concurrent installations and file locking issues.
- **App**: Improved global error handler to show more informative error messages with inner exception details.
- **FontInstaller**: Mapped all 10 JetBrains Mono font variants (Thin, Light, ExtraLight, etc.) to their correct Windows font names.
- **AnimationHelper**: Fixed animation holding issue where `FillBehavior.HoldEnd` prevented subsequent property changes.

### ♻️ Refactoring

- **Installer**: Made `RegistryHelper` and `ShortcutHelper` context-aware.
   - **Per-User Installs** (`%LocalAppData%`): Uses `HKCU` registry hive and user-specific Desktop/StartMenu shortcuts.
   - **System-Wide Installs** (`Program Files`): Uses `HKLM` registry hive and All Users Desktop/StartMenu shortcuts.
   - **Legacy Support**: `InstallationDetector` and `RegistryHelper` now scan both `HKCU` and `HKLM` hives to correctly detect and clean up any installation type.
   - **InstallerUpdateStrategy**: Rewrote update strategy for WPF installer — removed legacy Inno Setup batch script (`/VERYSILENT`), now directly launches installer with `--update` flag. Added UAC cancellation handling.
   - **InstallationDetector**: Replaced `unins000.exe` detection with registry-based detection (`HKLM` uninstall key) and `%LocalAppData%` path check. Supports both new WPF key and legacy Inno Setup `_is1` key suffix for backward compatibility.
   - **RegistryHelper**: Added legacy `_is1` registry key fallback for detecting old Inno Setup installations in `Program Files`. Automatically cleans up legacy key during migration. Strips `+commitHash` from `DisplayVersion` before writing to registry.

   - Active Mods Querying (`active-mods.md`)
   - Misc Mods Control (`misc-mods.md`)

---

## [2.1.12-beta] (Build 2087)

### 🚀 UI/UX

- **Progress**: Improved "Preparing" phase feedback in Skin Selector.
   - Status now shows real-time download percentage (e.g., "Downloading base files (45%)") instead of static "Preparing".
   - Re-enabled substatus display in `ProgressOverlay` to show detailed log messages (download size, extraction steps).

### 📡 Network

- **Resilience**: Added stall detection to `OriginalVpkService` for base file downloads.
   - Warns user after 30s of no data ("Download appears stalled").
   - Suggests troubleshooting steps after 90s.

---

## [2.1.12-beta] (Build 2085) - 2026-02-12

### 🚀 Added

- **CI/CD**: Improved release workflow with **NuGet caching**, **SHA256 checksums** for artifacts, and **automatic runtime installer downloading** (only if missing).
- **CI/CD**: Added build summary to GitHub Actions and upgraded to `action-gh-release@v2`.

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Installer**: Fixed critical regression in .NET 8 detection where running in 64-bit mode caused the installer to miss 32-bit registry keys (`WOW6432Node`). Now explicitly checks `HKLM32`.

---

## [2.1.12-beta] (Build 2084) - 2026-02-12

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Installer**: Removed unnecessary .NET 8 Desktop Runtime check for self-contained builds, fixing a blocking prompt during updates.
- **Installer**: Bundled .NET 8 Desktop Runtime installer for seamless auto-installation if needed (fallback).

---

## [2.1.12-beta] (Build 2083) - 2026-02-12

### 🚀 Added

- **Feature Access Control**: Added remote feature gating system via Cloudflare R2 (`feature_access.json`).
   - New `FeatureAccessConfig` model with fail-open defaults.
   - New `FeatureAccessService` with 5-minute cache and graceful error handling.
   - Skin Selector and Miscellaneous can now be remotely enabled/disabled with custom messages.
- **UI**: Added `FeatureUnavailableDialog` — WebView2-based dialog matching `progress.html` aesthetic (animated wave, corner decorations, monospace font) with native MessageBox fallback.

### ♻️ Refactoring

- **KV Parsing**: Consolidated three duplicate KeyValues parsing implementations into single source of truth in `KeyValuesBlockHelper`.
   - Added `heroId` filtering to `ExtractBlockById` and `ReplaceIdBlock` to prevent false matches on short numeric IDs (e.g., ID `"99"` matching in `kill_eater_score_types` instead of `items`).
   - Enhanced `NormalizeKvText` with smart-quote (`""`→`""`), smart-apostrophe (`''`→`''`), non-breaking space, and zero-width character handling.
- **HeroSetPatcherService**: Refactored to delegate all KV parsing to `KeyValuesBlockHelper`, removing ~200 lines of duplicate code. Domain logic (validation, indentation normalization, file discovery) preserved.

### 🗑️ Removed

- **Dead Code**: Deleted `GeneratorService.cs` (zero references). Its superior text normalization logic was merged into `KeyValuesBlockHelper.NormalizeKvText`.

### 🧪 Testing

- Added 14 new unit tests for `KeyValuesBlockHelper`: heroId filtering (4), smart-quote normalization (2), zero-width char stripping, non-breaking space handling, BOM removal, `ParseKvBlocks` (3), `ReplaceIdBlock` with heroId (2).
- Added 16 new unit tests for `FeatureAccessConfig` model and `FeatureAccessService` (total: 285 tests).

## [2.1.11-beta] (Build 2082) - 2026-02-10

### ♻️ Refactoring

- **Architecture**: Decomposed `MainFormPresenter` into 3 specialized presenters for SRP (`ADR-0004`):
   - `ModOperationsPresenter` - install, reinstall, disable operations
   - `PatchPresenter` - patch updates, verification, watcher
   - `NavigationPresenter` - hero selection, miscellaneous forms
- **DI**: Created specialized registration methods (`AddCoreServices()`, `AddConflictServices()`, `AddHeroServices()`, `AddLoggingServices()`, `AddPresenters()`, `AddUIFactories()`).
- **Tests**: Added `TestServiceFactory` helper for cleaner test setup without ServiceLocator.

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Installer**: Switched `.NET 8` Desktop Runtime detection from CLI-based (`dotnet --list-runtimes`) to registry-based check for improved reliability across system configurations.

### 📝 Documentation

- **ADR**: Rewrote all existing ADRs (0001–0004) to full MADR format with Problem Statement, Decision Drivers, and Alternatives Considered.
- **ADR**: Added 3 new Architecture Decision Records:
   - `ADR-0005` - WebView2 Hybrid UI strategy
   - `ADR-0006` - Automated Patch Watcher system
   - `ADR-0007` - Security & Anti-Tamper architecture
- **ADR**: Created ADR index (`README.md`) and standardized `TEMPLATE.md` based on MADR format.

### 🗑️ Removed

- **Legacy**: Completely removed `ServiceLocator.cs` from production and test code.
- **MainForm**: Replaced obsolete default constructor with `NotSupportedException`.

### 🧪 Testing

- Added 26 new unit tests for specialized presenters (total: 269 tests).
